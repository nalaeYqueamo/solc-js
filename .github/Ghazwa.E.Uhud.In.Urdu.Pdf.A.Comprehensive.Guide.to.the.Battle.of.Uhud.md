## What was the background of the Battle of Uhud?
  
The Battle of Uhud was a sequel to the Battle of Badr, which was the first major confrontation between the Muslims and the Quraish. The Battle of Badr was a resounding victory for the Muslims, who defeated a much larger and better-equipped army of the Quraish. The Quraish suffered heavy losses, including many of their leaders and nobles.
  
The Quraish were humiliated and enraged by their defeat at Badr. They vowed to take revenge on the Muslims and to wipe out Islam from Arabia. They started to prepare for a massive attack on Madinah, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers had migrated.
  
The Quraish mobilized an army of about 3,000 men, led by Abu Sufyan, their chief. They also enlisted the support of some Arab tribes, such as Banu Kinanah, Banu Nadr, Banu Sulaim, Banu Asad, and Banu Fazarah. They also hired some poets and singers to incite and motivate their soldiers.
  
The Quraish marched towards Madinah with their army, carrying their women and children along with them. They wanted to make this battle a decisive one, and to show their determination and courage to their enemies.
  
## How did the Muslims prepare for the Battle of Uhud?
  
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was informed by Allah (SWT) about the impending attack of the Quraish. He consulted his companions about how to deal with the situation. Some of them suggested that they should stay inside Madinah and defend it from within. They argued that Madinah had strong fortifications and natural barriers that would make it difficult for the enemy to enter.
  
Others suggested that they should go out and meet the enemy in an open field. They argued that this would show their bravery and faith in Allah (SWT), and that they would have a better chance of defeating the enemy as they did at Badr.
  
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) preferred the first option, as he was guided by divine revelation. However, he respected the opinion of his companions and agreed to go out and face the enemy. He ordered his companions to get ready for battle and to follow his instructions strictly.
  
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) gathered an army of about 1,000 men, including some hypocrites who pretended to be Muslims but secretly plotted against Islam. He also appointed Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul as one of his commanders, as he was a leader of the hypocrites and had a large following among them.
  
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) left Madinah with his army and headed towards Uhud. On his way, he received news that Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul had deserted him with 300 men, claiming that there was no need to fight as Madinah was safe. This reduced the Muslim army to 700 men.
  
## What happened at the Battle of Uhud?
  
The Battle of Uhud took place on Saturday, 15th Shawwal, 3 AH (23rd March, 625 CE). The Quraish army reached Uhud first and camped at its foot. The Muslim army arrived later and camped on a slope facing Uhud.
